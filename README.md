# CyberSecurity_Elevate-Labs
This repository is a central hub for my daily tasks during the Cyber Security Internship with Elevate Labs. Each project and task is logged here, creating a comprehensive portfolio of my work and learning.

**What's Inside?**
Task-specific folders: Every task, such as task-1-local-network-scan, has its own dedicated folder.

**Documentation:** A detailed README.md in each task folder explains the objective, the steps I took, the tools I used, and the outcomes.

**Artifacts:** This includes all the necessary files from each task, such as code, scan results, screenshots, and other relevant assets.

This repository demonstrates my practical skills in areas like network reconnaissance, port scanning, and fundamental network security. It's a testament to my commitment to learning and problem-solving, showcasing my journey through the internship.
